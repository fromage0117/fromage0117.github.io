        <h1>Gilles' Australian Garlic</h1>
        <p>
          A usual, Gilles will be selling loose and plaited garlic at the
          Northside Produce Market for both of the November and December
          markets. The purple garlic is looking very good at this stage but
          unfortunately we lost our entire crop of white garlic due to flooding.

        <h2>Markets</h2>
        <p>
          The markets are on the first and third weekends of the month, starting
          at 8:00 and ending at 12:00.
        </p>
        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>Ted Mack Park, 200 Miller Street, North Sydney</p>

        <h3>When</h3>

        <p>
          <b>5 November:</b> We will have fresh garlic and garlic scapes. This is a once a year
          opportunity to enjoy these products. The garlic is just formed into
          cloves and is amazingly juicy and crunchy, with a milder garlic
          flavour. It is less pungent than mature garlic. The scapes are the
          inner stalk of the garlic. They are popular in Asian stir fries, and
          may be prepared in a stir fry, raw in a salad or cooked as you would
          cook asparagus. We will only have them at this market.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>19 November:</b> We will have fresh garlic at this market. The cloves are now fully
          formed while the garlic remains juicy and crunchy. It is more pungent.
          You can only buy garlic as fresh as this from a grower as the garlic
          is still fragile, not being fully dried. You can keep it and dry it
          but it is so delicious fresh!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3 and 17 December:</b> We will have plaits of all the usual sizes: $15, $25, $40, $50 and a
          few at $100.
