        <h1>Gilles' Australian Garlic</h1>
        <p>
          A usual, Gilles will be selling loose and plaited garlic at the
          Northside Produce Market for both of the November and December
          markets. The purple garlic is looking very good at this stage but
          unfortunately we lost our entire crop of white garlic due to flooding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The markets are on the first and third weekends of the month, starting
          at 8:00 and ending at 12:00.
          <p><b>Address: </b>Ted Mack Park, 200 Miller Street,
            North Sydney</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Market dates</h2>
        <h3>5 November</h3>
        <p>
           We will have fresh garlic and garlic scapes. This
          is a once a year opportunity to enjoy these products. The garlic is
          just formed into cloves and is amazingly juicy and crunchy, with a
          milder garlic flavour. It is less pungent than mature garlic. The
          scapes are the inner stalk of the garlic. They are popular in Asian
          stir fries, and may be prepared in a stir fry, raw in a salad or
          cooked as you would cook asparagus. We will only have them at this
          market.
        </p>
        <h3>19 November</h3>
        <p>
           We will have fresh garlic at this market. The
          cloves are now fully formed while the garlic remains juicy and
          crunchy. It is more pungent. You can only buy garlic as fresh as this
          from a grower as the garlic is still fragile, not being fully dried.
          You can keep it and dry it but it is so delicious fresh!
        </p>
        <h3>3 and 17 December</h3>
        <p>
          We will have plaits of all the usual sizes:
          $15, $25, $35, $50 and a few at $100.
